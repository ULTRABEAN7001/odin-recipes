        <h4>French onion soup is certainly of european origin more specifically French oui oui baguette. It is a warm comforting soup that is mostly made of soup as said in it's name. It is a very much french dish that is widely known around the world and is well recieived by others. The flavors complement each other very well and give a rich and comforting feeling for those that consume it.</h4>
        <h4>The main star in this soup is the large amount of onions used. More specifically caramelized onions. When they are cooked for a long time they develop a brown color and a sweeter taste but at the cost of the size of the onions due to the water lost in the process. To make up for this large amounts of sliced onions are used to make sure there is a sufficient amount of onions that can be used ht esoup to provide a good amount of flavor while not sacrificing the amount that can be eaten.</h4>
        <h4>The process in making these may take a while but it is very much rewarding because it its amazing flavor.

If you're a bignner this will be a wonderul introduction the the world of cooking.</h4>
